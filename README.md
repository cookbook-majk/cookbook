# Cookbook

Cookbook is a web-based application designed to help users store recipes into their profile for everyone who searches them or follows them to see. With Cookbook, you can save other people’s recipes so you can try and make them later. You can also write reviews about other’s recipes you have tried, and the overall rating will be displayed on the recipe itself.

Cookbook features a kitchen mode that presents all the instructions of how to cook a dish presented in a way that ensures the user can begin cooking and not have to touch the display throughout the entire process. There are search capabilities that allow the User to look for new recipes based on filtered parameters along with a trending and most popular feed.
